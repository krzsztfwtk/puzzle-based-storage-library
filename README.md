# puzzle-based-storage-library
library for route programming in puzzle-based storage systems and other similar systems

At this point, the library has implemented single-item retrieval in puzzle-based storage parking systems, incorporating Dijkstra's and A* algorithm and Manhattan Distance, Chebyshev Distance, and an occupancy-based variant of Manhattan Distance heuristics.

The library is implemented in C++.

After building with `make` you can explore preset scenarios. Run program with:

```bash
./bin/main <scenario> <arg1> <arg2> ... <argN>
```

where `scenario` is a number of scenario to run and `arg1`, `arg2`, `argN` are parsed further to the chosen scenario.

Refer to `scenarios.cpp` for example usage of the library. You can also implement your own custom scenarios.

## Example usage

This runs single-item retrieval (scenario01) on 5x5 parking lot with only orthogonal movement allowed. Visualization is enabled on the command line and its speed is set to one parking status per 1.5 s.

```bash
./bin/main 1 5 5 20 1 1500
```
